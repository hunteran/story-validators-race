# About Me
My name is Long, I am a programmer with over 5 years of experience in C# and 1 year in Web3. I have the ability to build smart contracts, write APIs, and develop DApps. I am active in the community and the founder of Unityhub (https://www.unityhub-inc.com/), which is currently managed by my wife. I also have Listing Partnerships with over 35 exchanges, and I am the team leader of the Xai Vietnam group.

As a programming enthusiast, I am eager to expand my knowledge and apply my skills to support the community.
